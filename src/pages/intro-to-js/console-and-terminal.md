We will be using the integrated terminal in vscode to run our js files.  To run a js file we open the terminal in vscode:

`terminal > new terminal`

Than we run the command

```
node <name-of-file>
```

some other command line commands you might want to know

```
cd: change directory
touch: create a file
mkdir <folder-name>: make a directory
ls: list directory contents
pwd: see where you are
```

**remember to save the file before you run it**


**if you still can't get it to run you can come to this link and run the code [here](https://replit.com/@jimibue/js-playground-1#index.js)**
